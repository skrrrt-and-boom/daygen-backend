# Credit System User Guide

Understanding how credits work in DayGen.

---

## Two Types of Credits

DayGen uses a **dual-wallet system** with two types of credits:

### 1. Subscription Credits
- ✅ Included with your monthly/yearly subscription
- ⏰ **Reset** each billing cycle (not rolled over)
- 📅 Expire at the end of your billing period
- 🔄 Used first when generating content

### 2. Top-Up Credits
- 💳 Purchased separately as one-time packages
- ♾️ **Never expire** - use them anytime
- 💰 Used only after subscription credits are depleted
- 🔒 Carry over between billing cycles

---

## Credit Usage Priority

When you generate content, credits are deducted in this order:

```
1. Subscription Credits (used first)
      ↓
2. Top-Up Credits (used second)
      ↓
3. Grace Credits (small buffer, ~50 credits)
```

> [!TIP]
> Top-up credits are a great backup - they never expire and only get used after your subscription allowance is exhausted.

## FAQ

**Q: What happens to my subscription credits if I don't use them all?**
> They reset to zero at the end of your billing cycle. Unused subscription credits do not roll over.

**Q: Will my top-up credits ever expire?**
> No! Top-up credits are permanent and never expire. Use them whenever you want.

**Q: Which credits are used first?**
> Subscription credits are always used first. Top-up credits are only touched after your subscription allowance is exhausted.

**Q: What is the "grace" buffer?**
> A small ~50 credit buffer that lets you complete a job even if you're slightly over zero. This prevents jobs from failing mid-generation.

**Q: Can I have a subscription AND buy top-ups?**
> Yes! Many users combine a subscription for regular use with occasional top-ups for busy periods.

**Q: What happens if I cancel my subscription?**
> Your subscription credits will be available until the end of your current billing period. Your top-up credits remain available forever.
